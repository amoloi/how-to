# Adding Java to alternatives #
================================

This will apply to centos distro that uses alternatives and update-alternatives for managing java.

  alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/kdk14/bin/java 2

  alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /opt/kdk14/bin/javac 2

The above would add java to position two within alternatives. Position two is chosen because position 1 was already desgnated to java 8.

  update-alternatives --config java

and then choose position 2 to let centos use the version just installed.

Check java version :

  java -version
